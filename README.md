This is a learning by doing React app to implement the [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://playtictactoe.org/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running App

You can clone the repository or download the zip file.<br />
In the downloaded project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
